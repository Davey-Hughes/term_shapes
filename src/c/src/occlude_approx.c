/*
 * first approximation of occluding points
 *
 * operates by finding the angle between the vectors given by the point to the
 * center of the object and the point to the center of projection. This is only
 * an approximation as the angle given by this calculation doesn't determine
 * entirely whether a point should be occluded. The threshold is given by pi/3,
 * but as this is approximate it can be adjusted.
 *
 * returns 0 if point should be rendered, else 1
